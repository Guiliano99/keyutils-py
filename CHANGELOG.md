# Unreleased

## Changed

- FrodoKEM algorithm identifiers now follow
  [draft-smyslov-lamps-frodokem-certificates-03](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-smyslov-lamps-frodokem-certificates-03.txt)
  (ISO/IEC 18033-2 KEM arc `1.0.18033.2.2.7`) instead of the former ad-hoc
  test-suite arc. The old FrodoKEM OIDs are no longer recognised.

  | Name                  | OID                   |
  |-----------------------|-----------------------|
  | `frodokem-976-shake`  | `1.0.18033.2.2.7.1`   |
  | `frodokem-1344-shake` | `1.0.18033.2.2.7.2`   |
  | `frodokem-976-aes`    | `1.0.18033.2.2.7.5`   |
  | `frodokem-1344-aes`   | `1.0.18033.2.2.7.6`   |

- The Chempat FrodoKEM composite OIDs were renumbered without gaps after the
  removals below (`chempat-frodokem-976-aes-x25519` and
  `chempat-frodokem-976-shake-x25519` keep their OIDs).

## Removed

These FrodoKEM versions are no longer supported because the draft assigns them
no OID, so they cannot be used in X.509 / PKIX structures:

- `frodokem-640-aes` and `frodokem-640-shake`: key generation, loading and all
  hybrid combinations.
- `chempat-frodokem-640-aes-ecdh-brainpoolP256r1` and
  `chempat-frodokem-640-shake-ecdh-brainpoolP256r1`.

## Not supported

- The eFrodoKEM-976/1344 variants: draft -03 assigns them OIDs (`.3`, `.4`,
  `.7`, `.8`), but they are not relevant for certificates and neither `liboqs`
  nor the bundled implementation provides them.
